              <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
              <p>In the Spring semester of 2016, I started to meet with a robotic design group called Tail-Gator. They were working on something truly amazing… a robot that cooked burgers! Entering the workshop, I saw student engineers hard at work. A group of students assembling the robot, speaking about “torque” and “actuators”. Another group soldering a bunch of gadgets and doohickeys together, talking about “motor drivers” and “voltage regulators”. Huddled up at a table, students typing away on their laptops controlling what looked like alien technology, with lights and displays flashing away. It became clear to me fast… I was way out of my league. I knew NOTHING about computer hardware, circuits or even programming.</p>
              <p>But it didn’t matter. It was too late. I was hooked. I wanted to be part of that. I needed to be part of this world. I went and bought myself an Arduino kit and taught myself how to use it. I learned how to control motors, servos, LEDS, various displays and more importantly how to program. And that was it. By the end of that Spring Semester I had joined a robotics design team called Aggregator and had officially changed my major to Computer Engineering.</p>
              <p>I haven’t stopped learning since.</p>
              <p>I’ve gained experience in C++, the Robotic Operating System, Arduino, Odroid microprocessors and circuit design working in Aggregator to help program and assemble a competition robot. I’ve worked with a team of dentists and psychologists to create Virtual Reality experiences to help relieve patients of pain related stress utilizing Unity 3D and C#. I’ve learned to create modern web applications with MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js, using JavaScript, HTML and CSS to create an Employee Scheduling Application for a local business.  I used that same knowledge to become web director of UFMEDLIFE where I have since created a custom web application and member point-tracking system which I now actively maintain and update.</p>
              <p>I’ve loved every minute of it. And the best part is, after two years of growing, creating and learning, I know for a fact that I'm just getting started.</p>
